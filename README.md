# Api Gateway Using Ocelot
Ocelot is an open-source API Gateway designed for .NET applications, particularly those using microservices or service-oriented architecture. It acts as a unified entry point for your system, managing requests and responses between clients and backend services. Ocelot offers features like routing, request aggregation, authentication, authorization, rate limiting, caching, and load balancing.
It's built to work seamlessly with ASP.NET Core and supports integration with IdentityServer for handling tokens. Ocelot is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor it to your specific needs
